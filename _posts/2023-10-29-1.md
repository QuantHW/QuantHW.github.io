Finding a suitable accommodation feels as challenging as locating a needle in a haystack. My journey of searching for an apartment has been accompanied by some unusual queries from landlords and brokers, such as:

- Inquiring about my caste, religion, and gotra (idk why?).
- Asking about my alcohol and smoking habits.
- Wanting to know if I'm married.
- Inquiring about whether I have a “girlfriend” (I have serious issues with this term).
  
These inquiries had certainly made the flat-hunting experience quite unique, to say the least. I didn’t expect this at all. 

But finally I got one flat near my office (4 kms though, have to take bus to reah my office) and I have been staying here now from the part three months. Journey so far was, I would say, **"O.K."**. I have to plan things to smoothen my stay in this city. 
I generally go to the office early in the morning (around 7:30 AM) to avoid the traffic. For 4 kms its 20 min atleast  (excluding waiting for the bus), otherwise it may take more than that. There is no restriction that I have to stay in the office for 8 hrs as such because of the hybrid mode but I prefer to work from office and stay there till 4:30 PM. After that I have to plan what I should do to utilize the time and keep myself busy. 
I have started reading this book **India that is Bharat** by JSD. I have been listening to his views since my UPSC preperation days and after watching his interview on lallantop I decided to buy his book. His views appear to me quite radical but **आ नो भद्राः क्रतवो यन्तु विश्वतः** because that is how one will challenge his/her confirmation biases.

Guess what... I am going to Delhi on 1st Nov but before that tomorrow I have to give a presentation on this topic which I have been deliberating upon since joining this company: **Quantum Vision Transformers**
