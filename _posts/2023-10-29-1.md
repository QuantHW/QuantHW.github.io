Finding a suitable accommodation feels as challenging as locating a needle in a haystack. My journey of searching for an apartment has been accompanied by some unusual queries from landlords and brokers, such as:

- Inquiring about my caste, religion, and gotra (idk why?).
- Asking about my alcohol and smoking habits.
- Wanting to know if I'm married.
- Inquiring about whether I have a “girlfriend” (I have serious issues with this term).
  
These inquiries had certainly made the flat-hunting experience quite unique, to say the least. I didn’t expect this at all. 
But finally i got one flat near my office and I have been staying here now from the part three months.
