Puting here the text of a beautiful post that I found on twitter. 

When I have forgiven people in my life, it's because of three factors that slowly dawned upon me:
- The first was just being more objective and seeing that perhaps what they did wasn't really aimed at me. It was a byproduct and perhaps I misinterpreted or it was my fault.
- The second was valuing them and that moment for teaching me so I could make better decisions about people and situations in the future to improve my judgement and to develop wisdom around the long-term consequences of my actions and their actions.
- Most importantly, its just to get them out of my head. It's just not have to think about them. it's just not to have to carry a grudge. It's just not to have the emotional turmoil. It's just not to invoke the self. It's just to have peace and that's the best reason to forgive someone-just get them out of your head.
